# Functional and non-function requirements of the project "House Price Prediction"

## Functional requirements:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Collects and imports the datasets.
- Handle missing data, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Provide statistical summaries of different variables.
- Generate visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

3. Model Development:
- Implemented Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM models.
- Provide a function to train these models on the training set.

4. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Sqaure Error and R-Sqaured Score.
- Compare the performance of the three models.

5. Prediction:
- House price predictions using the best trained models.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Usability:
- User-friendly, with clear instructions and outputs.

2. Performance:
- Efficiently handle large datasets.
- Provide fast response times during model training and prediction.

2. Reliability:
- Produce consistent and repeatable results across different runs.

3. Maintainability:
- Well-structured code and easy to understand.
- Easy to modify for future enhancements.

3. Documentation:
- All functions and modules should be well-documented.
- Provide a comprehensive user manual or guide.
